		<p>Dice Wars is a turn-based board game built by <a href='https://gamedesign.jp' target='_blank'>gamedesign.jp</a>. I thought the game was fun but the AI was too weak and the matches became boring. Since they had made a javascript version of the game, I downloaded the source code and modified it to allow multiple types of AI player and tried my hand at creating a better AI. I can still usually beat the one I made, but mine regularly outlasts the original AI so it is a slight improvement. If you play my version, my slightly better AI are the pink, green and lime players.</p>

		<p>If you'd like to try making your own AI for this game, take a look at my <a href='https://github.com/chrisraff/dicewarsjs' target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> for it. It includes instructions to get you started. Let me know if you make any interesting AI!</p>
		
		<p>I hope to eventually add components to make AI creation easier for this game, like playing the AI against eachother quickly so you can analyze the performance of different AI.</p>
